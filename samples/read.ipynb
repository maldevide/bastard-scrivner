Take Ketchum, a public relations outfit owned by the holding company Omnicom Group, one of the mega PR firms. Vladimir Putin\\'s Russia was one of Ketchum\\'s largest clients. From 2006 to 2015, one of America\\'s greatest adversaries paid tens of millions in fees to an American public relations firm. In 2013, Ketchum placed an op-ed from Putin in the New York Times about the Syrian civil war. Ketchum also does work for the American government: the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service, and the U. S. Army. If you work for Russia, you should not have a U. S. government contract.\\n\\nIn 2004, Ketchum was accused of\\'covert propaganda\" when it used actors to play journalists in videos shot fora client. In this case, the U. S. Government Accountability Office found the firm in violation of the federal propaganda ban. But Ketchum\\'s campaigns have been awarded\\'Campaign of the Year\" at least six times by PRWeek, so they\\'ve got that going for them.\\n\\nAnd while we are telling tales out of school, let\\'s have a look atone of my favorites: Qorvis. Qorvis has the distinction of being the go-to PR firm for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Shortly after the events of September 11,2001, the kingdom hired Qorvis fora cool$ 14.7 million, paid between March and September 2002. One of the tactics deployed was to use an astroturf (or front) organization called the Alliance for Peace and Justice to run radio ads promoting Saudi messaging in the United States mere months after 9/11. When, in 2004, the FBI raided Qorvis\\'s offices, the firm called the raid a\\'compliance inquiry\" regarding the Foreign Agents Registration Act.', 'role': 'assistant'},\n",

It cost the Saudis$ 18.8 million in PR cleanup fees for killing just one person. Qorvis gobbled that money up between October 2018 and July 2019.\\n\\nForeign governments hire American PR firms because they\\'ve seen how skillfully we protect American politicians and corporations. In October 2004, prior to New York State governor Eliot Spitzer\\'s self-immolation, he looked into the American International Group (aka AIG), a massive finance and insurance company that in 2008 would need a significant bailout from the U. S. taxpayer for misbehavior. AIG did not care for the inquiry and hired Qorvis to ameliorate the situation. You know what\\'s easier than crisis communications? Paying people off to say nice things about your client. Twenty-five-thousand-dollar retainers and ten-thousand-dollar television appearance fees were offered to former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officials and think tank staffers.

PR pros invest a great deal of time and effort to bring hit pieces to fruition. Most often, clients want to see a hit piece on their primary competitor.

Their tax status and a few other legal t\\'s and i \\'s were not crossed and dotted. I knew this because my client knew this; he had the resources needed to obtain this information. All I needed was the appropriate messenger.\\n\\nWashington is littered with nonprofit organizations founded with the ideal of changing the world for the better. But ideals don\\'t keep the lights on. Money does. My client knew this. A significant private donation yielded a press release from a legitimate nonprofit and a letter of inquiry to the Department of Justice. Suddenly, my client\\'s enemy was less concerned with my client and more concerned with their own growing legal bills.\\n\\nOne afternoon over cocktails, I told Peter Brown this story.\\n\\n\"You\\'re an arsonist,\" he pronounced. \"Let me seethe picture of you and the First Lady of Mexico.\"', 'role': 'assistant'},\n",

PR pros get well paid for creating these shell nonprofits-in this case, $ 250,000. FFMI putout a stream of content hitting Amazon: Labor issues. Controversial items being sold on Amazon. Scandals in the C-Suite. All highlighted in tweets, press releases, and media statements by the FFMI.\\n\\nNormally, this would have been a win. There\\'s a catch. Often, clients don\\'t understand what they are getting themselves into when they commission hit pieces. You must look at every story you pitch as a potential Pandora\\'s box. You won\\'t find out exactly what\\'s inside until you open it. These are the risks when you play this game. Unintended consequences are to be expected. When a good journalist begins to look at the industry writ large, controversies about the client can come into play. Sometimes, the investigation spirals out of control. The hit piece against a competitor can turn on the client. If that happens, you have lost control of the narrative. \"Be careful he who hunts monsters, lest ye become a monster yourself.\" Or whatever Nietzsche said.

In the first few paragraphs alone, the piece describes Mrs. al-Assad as\\'breezy\" and\\'fun\" and calls Syria\\'a secular country where women earn as much as men and the Muslim veil is forbidden in universities, a place without bombings, unrest, or kidnappings, but its shadow zones are deep and dark.\"\\n\\nThe piece reads like the reporter spent a few days with Gwyneth Paltrow: \"Asma al-Assad empties a box of fondue mix into a saucepan for lunch,\" Buck writes. \"The household is run on wildly democratic principles. \"We all vote on what we want, and where,\" she[Asma] says.\" (For example, her children voted to make the chandelier over the dining table out of cut-up comic books.)

Thousands of protesters soon fill the streets of Damascus, calling for Assad\\'s head. When his troops beat them bloody, the world reacts live on Twitter. Later, Vogue tries to scrub any record of the article\\'s existence from the internet, and Anna Wintour has to defend herself in the pages of the New York Times.\\n\\nIn Libya, the Arab Spring escalates to civil war after Gaddafi\\'s army opens fire on protesters in Benghazi, killing hundreds. I think back to Srebrenica, to standing on the blood-soaked soccer pitch. That day, I wondered how long it would be before similar scenes played out in Libya and Syria. It took less than a year.

He then covertly met with members of Congress.\\n\\nEllsberg\\'s strategy here was quite cunning: under the Speech and Debate Clause of the U. S. Constitution, no member of Congress can be prosecuted for what they say on the floor. That\\'s right: a member of Congress could introduce the leaked information into the Congressional Record, making the whole thing public, and not face charges.

Print the thing off and physically hand it to a reporter. So many people leak documents via email. Email is forever. Once you hit Send, you have created what will someday be a public document.\\n\\nOn June 13,1971, the New York Times printed its first story on the leak. The government sued the paper. For fifteen days, the courts sorted out how the Constitution and the needs of the government should be balanced. During that time, Ellsberg went to the Washington Post while eluding an FBI manhunt. Two days prior to the Supreme Court\\'s decision, Ellsberg outed himself as the source. The Court ruled in favor of the New York Times. Ellsberg was arrested and charged, but all charges against him were dismissed in May 1973.\\n\\nThat is how you leak a document. Stop emailing. Don\\'t create a digital footprint.

The harbor was the same clear blue as the sky. In its midst was a small island that separated a cluster of wingbird ships that bobbed in the tide. The largest was Tjalan\\'s ship, the Royal Emerald, her green sails like bright leaves against the darker green of the island.\\n\\n\"The summit of that island is so pointed, it looks man-made,\" Micail said to Galara, in an attempt to distract his mind from the rocking of the fish-smelling round coracle in which they were being ferried out to the Emerald.', 'role': 'assistant'},\n",

Was there any point in trying to build anew Atlantis if Tiriki was lost?\\n\\nHe clutched the side of the coracle as the sea grew even more lively, astonished that the boy could govern the motion of so unlikely a craft.

He touched Galara\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\"Do you feel it?\"\\n\\n\"I feel sick.\" She looked pale and queasy. He remembered hearing her say that she did not like the sea. That must be why she did not notice the thrumming in the water.\\n\\nTiriki would have felt it. Awkwardly he patted Galara\\'s arm and then closed his eyes, swamped by anew wave of sorrow. Without her, I am crippled, he thought. The gods will not want me.\\n\\nWhen they came aboard at last, they found the deck of the Royal Emerald swarming with soldiers. Micail had not realized that Tjalan had brought not only his bodyguard, but a contingent of regular guards as well.\\n\\nThe soldiers remained on deck throughout the three days it took to sail north and east along the coast to Belsairath.

The outskirts of the old town were a sprawling expanse of new-looking villas, builtin the aristocratic Alkonan style, with much of the building hidden underground.

Silly girl, she told herself, did you actually think there could be no beauty in the new land?\\n\\nA last scramble brought her to the summit-a gently rounded oval expanse with a coverlet of the same richly green turf. Even in that first moment, half blinded by glorious sunlight, she was aware of it, like another kind of radiance...\\n\\nHer eyes adjusted quickly. From here, high above the primeval forest that girdled the Tor, even the marshes below revealed to her a strange, wild beauty, for the vast fields of green spring reeds were spangled and veined with pale blue whenever the water reflected the sun.\\n\\nMagnificent, she told herself, but her sigh of appreciation at once gave way to a sudden stab of nostalgia. In Ahtarrath she and Micail had often greeted the day from the summit of the Star Mountain, where the blazing sun above the diamond sea had revealed each and every feature of the countryside and glittered on a thousand decorated rooftops with breathtaking clarity. Here, even on a cloudless day, the view fell away into a misty shadow of rolling hills backed by a foreign sea.\\n\\nIn Ahtarrath she had always known who and where she was. Here she had no such clarity. Instead, what she saw in the subtly veiled landscape before her was... possibility.\\n\\nSlowly she turned, noting how the long ridge to the south and the higher hills to the north sheltered the levels between.

Even Chedan could not tell if the auras of the others had grown brighter or if it was his own vision that had changed; yet he could see each member of the circle plainly-and not only their physical features. Chedan knew that he was looking into their very spirits. The merest glance at Liala revealed her dedication and her pride, and the need for love that yearned within her soul; but then all was subsumed as the greater power flowed, a great pillar of light, arcing between earth and heaven.', 'role': 'assistant'},\n",

Of course, Damisa knew that in the troubled times before the rise of the Sea Kings, a fair number from the other castes had been taken in. She herself came of the royalty of Alkonath, and Selast was of the pure noble stock as well, but the majority of the acolytes had ancestors of more humble origins.\\n\\nNot that it mattered anymore. Damisa sighed. We girls will just have to lie down with one another, as they say the warrior women do on the plains of the Ancient Land...

Sarsen rock was a kind of sandstone, but forces which even Ardral could not entirely explain had in some distant eon compressed it so that it was both harder and more dense that any natural rock the Atlanteans had ever seen.

A few of the glorious and shining robes of Atlantis still remained, but they were rarely worn anymore; and as their ordinary linen garb fell to rags, many of the refugees had begun to go about in simple garments of deerskin, like the people of the marsh.\\n\\nBut that may not last, she told herself, catching sight of one of the village women clumsily carding wool. Now that the priest Dannetrasa\\'s maps had allowed Reidel\\'s sailors to find more sheep to import, spun cloth was beginning to gain in popularity, and Liala and the saji women had begun to process the local wild flax, dyeing it with a native herb that made a lovely blue.', 'role': 'assistant'},\n",

Tiriki had come to realize that in this unknown wilderness, land and air and water did not have the same clear identities she had known on Ahtarrath. In the mists, they all tended to blur together, just as the caste distinctions between priest and sailor and native had begun to fade.\\n\\nThe acolytes and others who were her students were waiting in the clearing that they had carved out of the tangled ferns and alders in the midst of the isle. The energy in this spot had a certain youthful quality that made it appropriate for teaching the young. Not that her students were that youthful. In the interests of evening the ratio of priests to priestesses, they had adopted Reidel into the ranks of the junior priesthood and, after long debate, the sailor Cadis, as well.', 'role': 'assistant'},\n",

Here, the whole community-except fora few sailors who had married native women and lived with them in the village-gathered around along central hearth whose smoke spiraled upward through the thatch of the peaked roof.\\n\\nAtone end, the little statue of Caratra stood upon a plinth made from a stout log.

At home, she had served Light in the form of mighty but distant Manoah, whose presence was experienced only in the most rarified ecstasies of trance. But at the Tor they lived close to the earth and it seemed more fitting that the Mother who never abandons Her children should have Her home here at the center of the community.\\n\\nTiriki looked again about the crowded dining hall and smiled, remembering her teacher Rajasta\\'s words, \"But it is man, not Manoah, who needs testimonials in stone.

Micail climbed upon the embankment that circled the henge and gazed northward across the ditch, shading his eyes with his hand to make out the line of sweating men who hauled it. Others ran ahead, ready to dart in and replace anyone whose strength failed, clearing the track ahead for the rounded wooden runners that carried the load.\\n\\nA stand of singers could lift such a stone fora short time; seven times that number might even transport it overland if the distance was not too great, but there were no longer enough singers left in all the world to levitate one of the great sarsens all the way across the plain. And to raise the stones once they had been brought to the circle would require the talents of all the trained singers who remained.\\n\\nThey had tried moving the stones with oxen, but men worked harder and longer, and they were easier to train. King Khattar seemed unable to comprehend why Micail thought that a problem. For generations, once the emmer wheat and barley were well up and the cattle had been driven to the hill pastures in the care of girls and young men, the king would call out the levy. One able-bodied man from each farmstead or hamlet was expected to report for community labor. That was how the great ditched enclosures had been made, and the barrows, the wooden henges, and probably the older circles of standing stones as well.\\n\\nThere is still so much that we do not know, thought Micail. I only hope we do not come to rue the gaps in our knowledge. Turning, he surveyed the five pairs of sarsen stones that already stood within the circle. Despite his misgivings, he felt a thrill of satisfaction at the sight of those sharply hewn shapes against the sky. Atlantean magic could not do all the work, but it had certainly helped speed it. It was beginning to seem as if a task that would have taken the entire labor force of all the tribes dominated by King Khattar nearly ten years to accomplish was going to be finished in less than three.

Tjalan and Antar and their officers squatted somewhat farther off, beside the sons of the chiefs of other tribes.\\n\\nTorches had been raised in front of the completed trilithon so that the king could continue to gaze raptly upon it.

Already, she had heard what sounded like a distant rumbling from the circle of stones, and realized that the Working had begun. But there was surprisingly little noise. It must be true, then, that the circle of stones captured sound. Now the figures of the people within it appeared to be wavering, as a distant scene might be distorted on a very hot day. But she did not think this country could produce the kind of heat needed for that to occur.\\n\\n\"My eyes see no more than yours do,\" she muttered. \"It is a by-product, I think of the vibration. Dust maybe rising from the soil, or perhaps the light is simply... distorted. You can feel it through the ground.\"\\n\\nAt least I can, she thought, though Tjalan\\'s sturdy soldier\\'s sandals might insulate him from the tremor that came through the thin soles of her own sandals, queasily reminiscent of the way the earth of Ahtarrath had trembled before the Sinking. She considered advising him to bend down and put his ear to the ground, but that would probably not have accorded with his dignity.

The priest was pale and perspiring, with the fixed stare of one whose vision is focused within. Micail realized that Haladris could not see what was happening around him. The upright stones had been set deeply and braced in the pits that held them, but they had never been designed to resist such a protracted shaking.

For all that the dream promised her, there was a value in self-contempt, a counterpoint between her waking and sleeping hours, what was and what could be. A tension between what was real and what was imagined, or so Heboric would put it from his acid-pocked critical eye. The scholar of human nature held it in low opinion.

The attackers had come from the high grass lining both banks, first with arrow fire, then a rush to close with the hapless Malazans.\\n\\nThree wagons had been set aflame. The assassin sat motionless on his horse, studying the smoke-hazed heaps of charred wood, ash and bone. A small bundle of child\\'s clothing was all that remained of the victims\" possessions, a small knot of colour ten paces from the smouldering remains of wagons.\\n\\nAfter one last glance around in search of Apt– the demon was nowhere to be seen, though he knew it was close– Kalam dismounted. Tracks revealed that the train\\'s livestock had been led away by the ambushers. The only bodies were those that had been burned in the wagons. His search revealed that there had been survivors, a small group abandoning the scene and fleeing south, out across the Odhan. It did not appear that they had been pursued, but Kalam well knew that there was little chance of salvation out on the plain. The town of Orbal was five, perhaps six days away on foot, and it was likely that it was in rebel hands in any case, since the Malazan detachment there had always been undermanned.\\n\\nHe wondered where the refugees had come from. There was little to be found for leagues in any direction.\\n\\nMaking a sound on the sand like the beat of a skin drum, Apt ambled into view from downstream. The beast\\'s wounds had healed, more or less, leaving puckered scars on its black hide. Five days had passed since the D\\'ivers attack. There had been no sign that the shapeshifter still pursued them, and Kalam hoped that it had taken enough damage to be discouraged from persisting in the hunt.', 'role': 'assistant'},\n",
